                                The Homework Help program offers children assistance with their homework assignments.

Volunteers give children the tools they need to be successful in school.Virtual and in-person volunteer opportunities are available. If you would like to volunteer, please start the enrollment process by creating an account on the Children Center's Volunteer Site found HERE. After your account is created, the Children's Center will reach out to you within 2 business days to answer any questions and discuss the next steps.In accordance with the CMS Vaccine Mandate, those volunteering in-person at the Childrenâ€™s Center are required to be fully vaccinated and must provide proof of full vaccination upon request.
